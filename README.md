## Summary

Welcome to 3D Print Near Me, a pioneering decentralized application poised to revolutionize the 3D printing landscape. Much like platforms such as Uber and Airbnb, we're creating a sharing economy for 3D printing services, bridging the gap between those who own 3D printers and those in need of their services.

Our platform offers an innovative marketplace where users can acquire 3D printed items as NFTs, merging digital ownership seamlessly with physical creations. This unique approach allows for the purchase and ownership of one-of-a-kind 3D printed objects, adding a new dimension to the world of digital collectibles.

When it comes to crafting 3D items, we recognize the power of using multiple files. These diverse digital components come together harmoniously, enabling the creation of intricate and multifaceted 3D objects, enhancing their overall complexity and functionality.

Whether these objects are created for personal use or listed in our marketplace, they present income-generating opportunities, offering a versatile range of applications and experiences for our users. We invite you to explore this exciting world of 3D printing and ownership with 3D Print Near Me.

## How it was built

3D Print Near Me is an innovative NFT marketplace that brings together cutting-edge technologies to offer a seamless and secure experience for users. Here's a breakdown of how it was built:

1. **NFT Metadata with NFT.storage:** To create NFT metadata, 3D Print Near Me leverages NFT.storage, a reliable and decentralized storage solution. This ensures that the information associated with each 3D printed object is securely stored and easily accessible through the blockchain.

2. **Encrypted 3D Object Files with Lighthouse:** The platform uses Lighthouse to upload encrypted 3D object files. This encryption enhances the security and privacy of the 3D printing files, safeguarding the integrity of the designs throughout the process.

3. **Smart Contracts with Filecoin Virtual Machine:** Filecoin's Virtual Machine is utilized for executing smart contracts. This enables the automation of various processes within the platform, such as transaction management and the execution of agreements between users.

4. **Data Storage with Tableland:** Tableland serves as the data store for 3D printing orders and marketplace listings. This robust data storage solution ensures that user information, order details, and listings are efficiently organized and readily accessible when needed.

5. **Decentralized Compute with Lilypad:** For calculating the cost associated with printing each object, 3D Print Near Me relies on Lilypad for decentralized computing. This enables efficient and transparent cost calculations, ensuring that users have a clear understanding of the expenses involved in their 3D printing projects.

By harnessing the capabilities of these advanced technologies, 3D Print Near Me has created a secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform for the creation, sharing, and ownership of 3D printed objects as NFTs. This fusion of blockchain, decentralized storage, and smart contracts opens up new possibilities in the world of 3D printing and digital ownership.
